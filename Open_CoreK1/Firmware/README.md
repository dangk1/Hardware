Compiled firmware with correct RGB settings and 2 extra buttons added to OLED screen layout.
I know 0.7.6 added major feature (XBOX Passthrough) but it had a big bug causing DPAD + SOCD sliders to not function on the Open_CoreK1 so I skipped this firmware.
This has been fixed as of recent so I updated the firmware to 0.7.7 RC1


As of right now version is based on GP2040-CE 0.7.7 RC1
Will try to keep it updated with major firmware releases which add major bugfixes/features/improvements.
Dont expect me to update small releases/non big feature updates.
If it ain't broke dont fix it.

Heres my repository to see changes made to GP2040-CE firmware: https://github.com/dangk1/GP2040-CE
