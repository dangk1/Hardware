![Dang Open Core Enclosure 30x15 v4](https://github.com/dangk1/Hardware/assets/57189623/09194ded-7e93-46e8-9af1-8c9d158466ea)
This is an All Button Controller that uses slightly modified OpenCore0 PCB design by TheTrain. You can find the original repository here: https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/Open_Core0

The PCB is slightly modified to fit my personal taste for the layout and the placement of the 2 extra function buttons (dont like the placement on original design).
Also removed the case leds as we go for larger enclosure which make case leds pointless.
The enclosure was designed by myself in Fusion 360 and consist of 3D printed frame and insert held together by M2 Screws and heat inserts.
For the bottom I went with an 2mm acrylic plate but you can also use aluminium plate here.
And for the top we went with 3mm clear acrylic for the artwork finish.
Total thickness is 1,8cm and if you add 2mm it will round up to be 2cm total.

I used Gamerfinger HBFS-30 + HBFS-24 button caps because it's perfect height for the enclosure and I quite like them. THey feel better than the punk/sino low profile caps. (Difference between Punk and Gamerfingers with Kailh Choc V2 switches is that Punk caps have longer bottomming out and therefore also longer travel back to origin)
If you wish to use the punk/sino low profile caps simply use 2mm top acrylic and reduce 3D printed Frame + Insert by 1mm height. (I have not tested this but should work fine)
