This is an All Button Controller that uses slightly modified OpenCore0 PCB design by TheTrain. You can find the original repository here: https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/Open_Core0

The PCB is slightly modified to fit my personal taste for the layout and the placement of the 2 extra function buttons (dont like the placement on original design).
They are now placed at outer right tactile switches (previously L3+R3).
2 extra buttons on layout (L3+R3) to use with left pinky and right thumb.
Also removed the case leds as this design is a larger enclosure which make case leds pointless.
Pins on the PCB remained completely the same from original so you will not lose any functionality by flashing the original Open_Core0 firmware from GP2040-CE website.
However as there are 2 more buttons and we removed the case leds the RGB order is slightly different.
I compiled my own firmware with correct RGB settings and also added the 2 extra buttons in the OLED screen layout.

The enclosure was designed by myself in Fusion 360 and consist of 3D printed frame and insert held together by M2 Screws and heat inserts.
For the bottom I went with an 2mm acrylic plate but you can also use aluminium plate here.
And for the top we went with 3mm clear acrylic for the artwork finish.
Dimensions are 30cm wide by 15cm height.
Total thickness is 1,8cm and if you add 2mm it will round up to be 2cm total.

I used Gamerfinger HBFS-30 + HBFS-24 button caps because it's perfect height for the enclosure and I quite like them. THey feel better than the punk/sino low profile caps. (Difference between Punk and Gamerfingers with Kailh Choc V2 switches is that Punk caps have longer bottomming out and therefore also longer travel back to origin)
If you wish to use the punk/sino low profile caps simply use 2mm top acrylic and reduce 3D printed Frame + Insert by 1mm height. (I have not tested this but should work fine)

Screws and heat inserts used:

5x M2 3mm(length) 3,5mm(OD) heat inserts : https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005372220229.html

5x M2 6mm screws : https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32968097507.html

6x M4 : You can use any combination of M4 Chicago/Rivet screw you want. Just make sure they have correct length. (I used 16mm M4 screws with rivet nuts)
