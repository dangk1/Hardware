STL Files for 3D Print.

The 3D printed Frame and Insert is held together by heat inserts and M2 screws.
I opted for a 1mm foam sheet between the PCB and Insert just because I have a laser and foam at home but its perfectly fine without the foam. 

I added 2 different files for the insert, 1 to be used with 1mm insert foam, 1 without. (only difference is 0,8mm height)
I had these printed by a 3D print company because I don't have the build volume at home and dimensions were perfect. Everything sits flush.

When prototyping the design I split the frame in 2 and it worked fine also dimensions were good and everything sits flush so this is an option if you don't have the build volume which I reckon most dont have a 300mm build volume.
Aesthetically 1 piece for frame is ofcourse nicer but splitting frame in 2 is perfectly viable and practical.

PS: The frame is a bit harder to print than your typical flatbox due to sheer size and mass (warping). If you are confident your 3D printer is tuned go ahead and print (YMMV) otherwise I suggest just having it print by a professional farm.
    If you go the split frame route, a bottom plate (either acrylic or aluminium) is a must. If you go 1 piece frame, bottom plate is optional which would reduce thickness overall although I would still suggest a bottomplate.
